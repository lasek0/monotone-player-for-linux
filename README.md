# monotone-player-for-linux

based on monotone player from:
```
https://github.com/MobyGamer/MONOTONE/
```

SWINGIN1.MON and NO_ROADS.MON are mirrored version from MobyGamer's repository


This player is far from ideal player, since I spend on it only single evening
reversing MobyGamer's monotone player and implementing it for linux OS. But
in my opinion sound comes from pc speeker are close enough to make my
8-bit heart happy.
